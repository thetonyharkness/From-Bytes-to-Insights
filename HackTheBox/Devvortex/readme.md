# Enumeration

## TCP Port 80 - HTTP

Added `devvortex.htb` to my `/etc/hosts` file.

Found nothing interesting on main page, nothing when scanning for vulns and nothing when performing directory bruteforcing. Thus, I began to fuzz for subdomains.

Subdomain enumeration:

```nasm
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -u http://$IP -H "HOST:FUZZ.devvortex.htb" -fs 154
```

![Untitled](Untitled.png)

I then added the subdomain to my `/etc/hosts` file.

Starting back from square one on new site‚Ä¶

No interesting functionality on website. When performing subdirectory enumeration I received the following results:

![Untitled](Untitled%201.png)

The subdirectory that stood out was `/administrator` 

This could also be found by viewing the `robots.txt` file:

![Untitled](Untitled%202.png)

/administrator/:   

![Untitled](Untitled%203.png)

We have a Joomla admin login page. Let‚Äôs try to find creds.

Performed a `droopescan`:

![Untitled](Untitled%204.png)

When navigating to the first URL displayed by droopescan, we get very useful information:

![Untitled](Untitled%205.png)

This tells us the Joomla version is 4.2.6 and gives us interesting folders and files to check out.

I relied on HackTricks to help me enumerate and exploit Joomla as I haven‚Äôt worked with it before. This was a HUGE help: [https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/joomla](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/joomla)

Let‚Äôs first check for exploits for this Joomla version

I found an exploit on GitHub for [CVE-2023-23752](https://github.com/ThatNotEasy/CVE-2023-23752)

Let‚Äôs install and configure the tool, and then test it out.

# Exploitation

## CVE-2023-23752

I simply downloaded the [`joomla.py`](http://joomla.py) file from the GitHub repository and spun it right up:

![Untitled](Untitled%206.png)

Creds gained! `lewis:P4ntherg0t1n5r3c0n##`

![Untitled](Untitled%207.png)

We‚Äôre in üòé

Again, we will follow HackTricks to exploit Joomla by navigating to `System>Site Templates>Cassiopeia Details and Files`

We will select a php file - I went with `error.php` and we will edit the code to give us a reverse shell. I copied the one from `/usr/share/webshells/laudanum/php/php-reverse-shell.php` and edited the file to my attacker IP address and the port I wanted to listen on via netcat.

I outputted the contents of the reverse shell, copied them, and replaced the contents of the `error.php` file in Joomla and clicked Save.

When calling this page via curl, our reverse shell is established

# Privilege Escalation

## Local Enumeration & Lateral Escalation

Firstly, I stabilized my shell by issuing the below commands individually:

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/tmp

export TERM=xterm-256color

alias ll='ls -lsaht --color=auto'

# Keyboard Shortcut: Ctrl + Z (Background Process.) #

stty raw -echo ; fg ; reset

stty columns 200 rows 200
```

Now we have a fully stable shell with auto-completion and more ü§ë

I will quickly check for system users on the machine so I know where to potentially laterally escalate to

```sql
cat /etc/passwd | grep /bin/bash
```

We get `root` and `logan`

Given that we have mysql creds, let‚Äôs now login to mysql 

```bash
#Target machine
mysql -u lewis -p
```

![Untitled](Untitled%2011.png)

Referring to the information we gained from the exploit earlier, let‚Äôs select the database to `joomla`

```sql
use joomla;
```

We will now show tables in the `joomla` database

```sql
show tables;
```

![Untitled](Untitled%2012.png)

We get back a lot of results but I‚Äôd like to dig in to the `sd4fg_users` table.

Thus, let‚Äôs gather all information from this table

```sql
select * from sd4fg_users;
```

![Untitled](Untitled%2013.png)

This output contains a hash for the user `logan`. A user we know to exist on the machine from our enumeration earlier. I will copy this hash and analyze it with [https://hashes.com/en/tools/hash_identifier](https://hashes.com/en/tools/hash_identifier) 

Note: The command-line tool built-in to Kali `hash-identifier` did not recognize the hashes for me.

![Untitled](Untitled%2014.png)

I will now search for the Hashcat mode for this specific hash type

![Untitled](Untitled%2015.png)

I will copy the contents of the hash and place it in a file called `hash.txt`

I will then attempt to crack the hash via Hashcat

```bash
hashcat -m 3200 hash.txt /user/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

![Untitled](Untitled%2016.png)

Hash cracked!! `logan:tequieromucho`

I will now attempt to login as the `logan` user via SSH

![Untitled](Untitled%2017.png)

Retrieved the `user.txt` file

## Apport-cli as root

When running `sudo -l` we get the following:

![Untitled](Untitled%2018.png)

I will search for exploits for apport version 2.20

I find a link to a GitHub [page](https://github.com/canonical/apport/commit/e5f78cc89f1f5888b6a56b785dddcb0364c48ecb) showcasing a PoC exploit.

We must first generate a crash to have a crash file as there aren‚Äôt any in `/var/crash/`

```bash
#create a crash
sleep 13 * killall -SIGSEGV sleep
```

![Untitled](Untitled%2019.png)

Now, let‚Äôs perform the same thing as demonstrated to get `root`.

```bash
sudo /usr/bin/apport-cli -c /var/crash/_usr_bin_sleep.1000.crash
```

Select option ‚ÄúV‚Äù

We will get back a bunch of information, however, entering `!<command>` allows us to execute commands as `root`. I ran `!id` to confirm and then retrieved the contents of the `root` flag.
